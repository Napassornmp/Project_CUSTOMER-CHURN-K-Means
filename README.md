# Project_CUSTOMER-CHURN-K-Means
  The purpose is to identify customers in  High-Risk churn clusters and estimate the size of the potential churn group.
Methodology

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed churn proportions and key factors such as account balance, number of products, and active membership status.

2.Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and applied StandardScaler to ensure the clustering algorithm was not biased by different units.

3.Customer Segmentation:

4.Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

5.Applied the K-means algorithm to group customers with similar attributes.

6.Insight Extraction: Profiled each segment to identify "High-Risk" vs. "Loyal" customer behaviors.

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn on Kaggle
